/*
A tree where no leaf is much father away from the root than any other leaf. different balancing schemes allow different definitions
of "much farther" and different amount of work to keep them balanced.
Consider a hight-balancing schme where followig conditions should be checked to determine if a binary tree is balanced.

An empty tree is height-balanced.A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:
1. Left subtree of T is balanced
2. Right subtree of T is balanced
3. Right substree of t is balanced
3. The diffenent between height of left substree and right subtree is not more than 1
