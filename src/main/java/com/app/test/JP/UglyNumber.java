/*

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.



Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.


Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

Time Complexity:

In the worst-case scenario, the while loop inside the isUgly() method will run until n becomes 1.
For each iteration of the while loop, we perform constant-time operations.
Therefore, the time complexity of the solution is O(log n), where n is the input number.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the solution is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
We only use a fixed-size array primes to store the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, and a few integer variables for calculations.
Hence, the space complexity is constant, O(1).
In summary:

Time complexity: O(log n)
Space complexity: O(1)
